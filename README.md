# NYU Intermediate Macroeconomics ECON-UA 12

Python notebooks that reproduce data and code used in the class. Files with Python code in the form of Jupyter notebooks for individual topics are stored in the <a href="jupyter">jupyter</a> folder above.

You can view the Jupyter notebooks with existing output directly in the folder. If you want to edit and run the code, you can download the whole folder by clicking the green <tt>Code</tt> button above on the right, and then choosing <tt>Download ZIP</tt>. If you have your own Python installation (for example, <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a>), then you can run the code on your machine, or utilize a Python server you have access to.

You can also use the following publicly available services.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jborovicka/nyu-intermediate-macro/main)

In order to run the Jupyter notebooks in <a href="https://mybinder.org/">Binder</a>, click the above icon. When the Binder environment is started, you first have to install required packages that are not preinstalled by default. To do that, run the code in <a href="jupyter/installation_instructions_binder.ipynb">jupyter/installation_instructions_binder.ipynb</a> first. Then you can edit and run the notebooks within the Binder environment.

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jborovicka/nyu-intermediate-macro/)

In  order to run the Jupyter notebooks in <a href="https://colab.google/">Google Colaboratory</a>, click the above icon. When the Google Colab environment is started, follow instructions in <a href="jupyter/installation_instructions_colab.ipynb">jupyter/installation_instructions_colab.ipynb</a> to install required packages and link locally stored functions and data to Google Colab. Then you can edit and run the notebooks within the Google Colab environment.
